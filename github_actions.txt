GITHUB ACTIONS
• Trigger Mechanism: Ensures that new feature contributions, such as the Internship Re-
cruitment or academic innovation modules, do not introduce breaking changes to the main
development line.
• Checkout Code: Uses the actions/checkout action to pull the latest repository source
code into the virtual runner environment.
• Setup .NET 10 SDK: Configures the environment with the specific .NET 10 SDK required
for the project, ensuring consistency between local development and cloud build.
• Restore Dependencies: Executes dotnet restore to fetch all necessary NuGet pack-
ages, resolving external dependencies before the compilation phase.
• Build (Release Mode): Compiles the project using the Release configuration. This pro-
duces an optimized, production-ready binary and catches strict compile-time errors that
might be missed in debug builds.
• Step 5: Automated Testing: A modular step intended for executing unit and integration
tests (e.g., xUnit). It ensures that core logic, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
and application status transitions, remains functional.
